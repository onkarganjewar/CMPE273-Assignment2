# RESTful Location & Trip planner Service in Golang

This RESTful Web Service has several endpoints to store & retrieve locations. Implemented all the CRUD operations, used MongoDB for data persistence.

## Features   

•	Create a new location:  

```http
POST   /locations
```

•	Retrieve a stored location: 

```http
GET  /locations/{location_id}    
```

•	Update an existing location: 

```http
PUT /locations/{location_id}   
```

•	Delete a location: 

```http
DELETE /locations/{location_id}   
```


```Shell
Note: Location ids are nothing but the ObjectId (unique identifier of type BSON generated by MongoDB)   
```


## Requirements  
*	[Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) (I have used go1.5 on Windows)   
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)


## Installation

### Installing Go 
*	If you don't have it configured on your OS, check out [this official manual](https://golang.org/doc/install) for the step-by-step instructions to install Go.   

### Installing Packages

1. Install this repository/package using Go      
```Shell
go get github.com/onkarganjewar/CMPE273-Assignment2
```

2. Install the httprouter package  
```Shell
go get github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter
```

3. Install the MongoDB driver for Go
```Shell
go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2
go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson
```


### Deploying MongoDB

• All the instructions and relevant files for installing MongoDB can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)  

• You will also need to create a collection, and connect to that MongoDB deployment using a standard connection URI like this
 
 ```Shell
 mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds012345.mongolab.com:12345/<dbname>
 ```
 
## Demo

* Change directory to your workspace and start the server

 ```Shell
 go run tripplanner.go
 ```

* Application will now run at http://localhost:3022/

* Use any [REST client console](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rest-console/cokgbflfommojglbmbpenpphppikmonn) or [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) chrome extensions to test the following RESTful Web Services:
